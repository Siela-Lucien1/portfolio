        <h4>Recipe For Chicken Pot Pie</h4>
        <p> You'll need chicken, vegetables like carrots and peas, and some herbs like thyme and rosemary.<br> You'll
            also
            need a few pantry staples like flour, butter, and chicken broth.</p>
        <p> First, you'll need to preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Then, you'll need to cook your chicken in a
            skillet<br>
            until it's browned on all sides. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet and set it
            aside.<br>
            Then, you'll need to cook your vegetables in the same skillet until they're tender. After the vegetables
            are<br>
            cooked, you'll need to add the chicken back to the skillet, along with the chicken broth, flour, and herbs.
            Stir the mixture until it's thickened, and then pour it into a pie dish.</p>
        <p>Now, you'll need to make the crust! You can either use a store-bought crust, or you can make your own.<br> If
            you're making your own crust, you'll need to combine flour, salt, and butter in a bowl.<br> Then, you'll
            need to
            add cold water and mix until the dough comes together. Once the dough is ready, you'll need to roll it out
            <br>
            and place it over the top of the pie dish. Finally, you'll need to bake the pie for about 30 minutes, or
            <br>
            until the crust is golden brown. And that's it! You'll have a delicious chicken pot pie.
